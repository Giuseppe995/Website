# Website
Personal Portfolio Website. I am still working on it, currently just shaping an overall design just and basic functionalities with HTML.

This repository has been made to control the website that will be built to create an online portfolio with a CV section and a possible forum to speak about
daily/weekly challenges and tutorials.
